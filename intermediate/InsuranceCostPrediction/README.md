## Insurance Cost Prediction (Decision Tree)

This project applies a Decision Tree Regressor to predict medical insurance charges.

### Why Decision Tree?

Decision Trees model non-linear relationships and make predictions using a series of logical rules, making them easy to interpret.

### Concepts Used

* Decision Tree Regression
* Hyperparameter tuning (max_depth, min_samples_leaf)
* Model evaluation (MAE, MSE, R2)

### Learning Outcome

The model captures non-linear patterns in insurance data and provides an interpretable alternative to linear regression.
