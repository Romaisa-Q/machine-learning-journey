## House Price Prediction (Decision Tree)

This project uses a Decision Tree Regressor to predict house prices based on
features such as area, bedrooms, location, and condition.

### Concepts Used
- Decision Trees
- Categorical Encoding
- Regression Metrics (MAE, MSE, R2)

### Why Decision Tree?
Decision Trees are easy to interpret and can capture non-linear patterns
in housing data without feature scaling.
