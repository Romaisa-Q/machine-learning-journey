# Machine Learning Journey 🚀

This repository documents my step-by-step journey from beginner-level machine learning to advanced AI systems, with a strong focus on **learning by building real projects** instead of isolated theory.

The goal of this repository is not just to train models, but to understand **how machine learning and AI systems are designed, evaluated, and applied in real-world problems**.

---

## 📌 Learning Philosophy

* Learn concepts **through projects**
* Move from **simple logic → machine learning → AI systems**
* Focus on **understanding**, not just running code
* Use **industry-relevant tools and workflows**

## 🎯 Final Project Vision

**AI-Based Course Coverage Analyzer**

An advanced NLP system that:

* Takes course content and exam papers as input
* Performs semantic analysis
* Calculates how much of the course content is covered in the exam
* Generates an explainable coverage report

This project is designed to reflect **real-world AI applications in education**, such as academic quality assurance and syllabus evaluation.
