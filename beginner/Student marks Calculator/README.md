# 🎓 Student Marks Predictor (Beginner)

## 📌 Project Overview
This is a beginner-level Machine Learning project that predicts student marks based on study hours.
The goal of this project is to understand **simple linear regression**, data preprocessing, and model evaluation.

This project is part of my **Machine Learning Journey**, starting from fundamentals and gradually moving towards advanced concepts.
