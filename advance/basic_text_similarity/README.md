# Basic Text Similarity

This project demonstrates how text similarity can be calculated using simple word matching techniques without any machine learning or AI models.

## Concepts Used
- Text preprocessing
- Tokenization
- Set operations
- Similarity percentage calculation

## Limitation
This approach does not understand the semantic meaning of text and fails when different words express the same idea.
